# EnergyGUI
This is a GUI and a background graphing program. This measures the embodied energy, dollar cost and energy production of different renewable power sources. Then the GUI allows you to change values on the fly in a user convenient way. My wish was for this to be used on a webpage to give people a better idea of how much power different sources create and how much those sources cost. 

Also for the solar power this uses a solar insolation calculation for the determination of energy output. This is a theoretical value and should not be taken at face value. NASA releases solar insolation data and for future development I hope to import those values rather than a calculation. 

If you would like to put this on your webpage: Please feel free, but send me an email with the URL, I would love to come see it. 

Thanks!
